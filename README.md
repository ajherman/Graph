# Graph

Author: TEA

Mission: Explore strange new colorings, seek out new independent sets and cliques, boldly prove facts about J(v,k,i) and related graphs.

Before jokes are approved for the master branch, they should be showcased here in dev first.

TO DO:

1) Speed up lines using Sigma in fastIndSetFinder()
2) Make everything print to .txt files rather than console
3) Some kind of genetic algorithms thing to replace doing parallel independent runs
