# Graph

Author: TEA

Mission: Explore strange new colorings, seek out new independent sets and cliques, boldly prove facts about J(v,k,i) and related graphs.

Before jokes are approved for the master branch, they should be showcased here in dev first.

TO DO:

0) Figure out issue with complete graphs
1) This is a matter of taste, but I'd like to make our program write to a text file rather than printing...that way it's not super annoying if you accidentally close a window that had some results you just took 10 hours to compute
2) Put better comments in scripts, so that if we want to share this code with someone someday they won't tear their hair our trying to decipher it
