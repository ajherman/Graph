torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 43.88 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.68 GiB of which 22.74 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 954.00 MiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 227.35 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 8.65 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
