torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 154.26 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 44.40 GiB of which 43.00 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1.40 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 648.55 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.45 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
