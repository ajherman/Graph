Guide to interpreting minimal clique representations:

<x>: The number of vertices that are being intersected (the rest are excluded) to form the regions
vals: The sizes that occur in these regions
v sizes: the sizes of the vertices IF we restrict to region type x
i sizes: the sizes of the pairwise intersections IF we restrict to region type x
ODD-BALL: There is more than one v size
DISASTER: The actual solution is not the ceiling of the continuous solution
COUNTER-EXAMPLE: The active regions are not the same as in the continuous version
